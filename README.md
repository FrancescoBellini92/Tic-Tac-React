## Tic Tac Toe with React

Do you like tic tac toe? I hope you do, let's play some :)

This repo contains an enhanced version of the tic-tac-toe app described in the React official docs (https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)
I had quite some fun building this, and it helped me understand the core concepts of React
